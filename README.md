## 1) Data Used

**Data Description:**

Used a Kaggle Dataset 
"**[Bank Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn?select=Customer-Churn-Records.csv)**" 

Features:
RowNumber — corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output. CustomerId—contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank. 
Surname — the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank. CreditScore—can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank. 
Geography — a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank. 
Gender — it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank. Age—this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones. 
Tenure — refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank. 
Balance — also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances. 
NumOfProducts — refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank. 
HasCrCard — denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank. 
IsActiveMember — active customers are less likely to leave the bank. 
EstimatedSalary — as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries. 
Exited — whether or not the customer left the bank. 
Complain — customer has complaint or not. 
Satisfaction Score — Score provided by the customer for their complaint resolution. 
Card Type — type of card hold by the customer. 
Points Earned — the points earned by the customer for using credit card.

## 2) Questions

1) What is the demographic profile (age, gender, geography) of customers more likely to churn?
2) Is there a significant difference in churn rates between different geographic locations or genders?
3) How does the average account balance relate to customer churn? Are customers with higher balances less likely to churn?
4) Do customers with different numbers of products have varying churn rates?
5) What is the impact of customer tenure on churn rates? Do long-term customers exhibit different churn behaviour compared to new customers?
6) Are customers with credit cards more loyal than those without? Does having a credit card influence churn behavior?
7) Can we predict which customers are likely to churn based on their financial behavior and demographics?
8) What are the key factors contributing to customer churn? Which features have the most significant impact on predicting churn?
9) What strategies could the bank employ to retain high-value customers? (Explore churn patterns for high-value customers)
10) Are there common patterns in the behavior of retained customers that could be used to inform retention strategies?

## 3) Summary Findings

1) Customers aged 41-50 and 51-60 have the highest churn rates, indicating a vulnerable segment within the customer base. Among churned customers, France and Germany have the highest churn rates compared to Spain.
2) Churned customers have a higher average account balance, suggesting that financial status alone does not prevent churn.
3) Customers with credit cards have a slightly lower churn rate,  indicating that card ownership might contribute to customer retention.
4) The total customer base comprises 10,000 individuals. The overall churn rate is 20.38%, slightly above the target rate of 15%, highlighting the need for improved retention strategies.
5) Inactivity seems to be a significant factor contributing to churn, as seen in the higher churn rate among inactive customers. This emphasizes the importance of customer engagement and activity.
6) Spain experienced significant churn, losing 800 customers, which might indicate underlying issues in that market. France, despite having the most customers, also experienced the highest churn rate, losing 800 customers. Addressing the issues specific to the French market is crucial.
7) Customers with a tenure of 7 years exhibit a lower churn rate of 17%. Long-term relationships significantly reduce churn rates. Customers who have been with the bank for several years are more loyal and less likely to leave.
8) Younger customers are more stable and less likely to churn, possibly due to early brand loyalty or fewer alternative options. 
9) Customers aged between 51-60 years have a high churn rate. Customers in their 50's and 60's represent a vulnerable segment. Understanding their specific needs and addressing concerns is crucial for retention.
10) Both churned and retained customer groups have a balanced gender distribution, indicating that churn rates are not significantly influenced by gender.
11) Average satisfaction scores are similar between churned and retained customers, suggesting that other factors beyond satisfaction contribute to churn behavior.
12) Slightly over half of the customers are active, and the majority own credit cards, showcasing opportunities for engagement strategies based on these traits.


These findings provide valuable insights into the customer segments and factors influencing churn. Crafting targeted retention strategies addressing these specific points can enhance customer loyalty and reduce churn rates effectively.
